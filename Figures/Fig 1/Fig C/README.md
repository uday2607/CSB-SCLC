###### Figure 1C iii

**plot_num_states.py** generates **Fig 1C iii** using ``jsd.txt``.  ``jsd.txt`` is a text file which contains Number of states and values of JSD between WT Boolean states distribution and Random Networks Boolean states distribution.

[``Boolean_Random_Networks``](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/Boolean_Random_Networks) contains all the codes related to Asynchronous Boolean Update of 1000 Random Networks generated from WT SCLC network

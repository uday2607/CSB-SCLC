### Fig 1D

##### Fig 1D i

``racipe_bool.py`` generates the ``Fig 1D i`` using Boolean Simulation data which can be found [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/Simulation_Data) and RACIPE data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PKs5vHkXCoJm9Wcg7P4nBPdPrFJCxJ5B?usp=sharing). Place all data files into this folder and run the python script.

##### Fig 1D ii

``scatter_edge_perturb.py`` generates the **Fig 1D ii** using Edge Perturbed data which can be found [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/Simulation_Data/Edge_Perturbation_Data). Place data of only one trail in the folder and run the python script to generate the figure. The edge perturbation data can be generated using the codes present [here](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/Edge_Perturbation)

[``Edge_Perturbation``](https://github.com/uday2607/CSB-SCLC/tree/master/Additional_Codes/Edge_Perturbation) contains all the codes related to Asynchronous Boolean Update of Edge Perturbed networks (Edge sign change/ Edge Deletion) derived from WT SCLC network.
